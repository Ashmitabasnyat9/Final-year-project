# Chapter 1 Introduction
1.1 Introduction

In the recent years, there has been an exponential progress in the field of machine learning and
artificial intelligence which has led to improvement in accuracy, reduction in human efforts
and failure rate. This development has played a commendable role in reducing processing
time, which has further led to improvement in net productivity and corresponding reduction in
the cost.
Object Detection(OD) is a challenging and exciting task in computer vision.It can be difficult
since there are all kinds of variations in orientation, lighting, background and occlusion that
can result in completely different images of the very same object.
The widely used object detection applications are human–computer interaction, video surveillance, satellite imagery, transport system, and activity recognition. In the wider family of deep
learning architectures, convolutional neural network (CNN) made up with set of neural network layers is used for visual imagery. Deep CNN architectures exhibit impressive results for
detection of objects in digital image.
The project comes with the technique of "Object Classification Using Light Weight CNN"
which includes various research sides of computer science. The project is to take a picture of
an object and process it up to recognize the image of that object like a human brain recognize
the various objects[1]. The project contains the deep idea of the Image Processing techniques
and the big research area of machine learning(ML) and the building block of the machine
learning called Neural Network .

# 1.2 Problem Statement

Object detection is a bit more complex task. We donot have proper algorithm to create the
automated system and real time object detection. So through this project different real time
objects can be easily detected even in the low resolution and develop a machine learning model
that can predict the object present in an image in real-time using a lightweight convolutional
neural network (CNN) architecture. Using CNN, it resolves problems like overfitting and also
reduces time complexity. It can have input as images in proper grayscale size and then the
images are fragmented in smaller sizes for better clearity and understanding of machine.

# 1.3 Project Objectives

The main objective of this project is to design and implement a CNN that can accurately predict
objects in real-time using the CIFAR10 dataset . The specific goals of the project are:
1. To train the model on the CIFAR10 dataset and evaluate its performance in terms of
accuracy and speed.
2. To optimize the model to reduce the response time and improve the prediction accuracy,
making it suitable for various real-world applications.

# 1.4 Scope and Limitations
The scope of the "Object Classification Using Light Weight CNN" project encompasses the
following areas:
1. The project aims to develop a CNN model that can accurately predict objects in real-time
with a fast response time.
2. The model performance will be evaluated in terms of accuracy and response time, and
further optimized to improve its performance.
The "Object Classification Using Light Weight CNN" project may face the following limitations:
1. More than 10 objects cannot be detected.
2. The model may not perform well on real-world objects and scenes that are significantly
different from those in the CIFAR10 dataset, leading to lower accuracy and prediction
errors.
3. The model may not generalize well to other datasets and real-world scenarios, requiring
further fine-tuning or transfer learning techniques to adapt to new environments.
# 1.4.1 Development Methodology
The model chosen for this system is “WaterFall model”. This is a simple project with the
well-defined process and the requirement. The various steps of the waterfall model is followed
throughout the whole project. This model is understood and incorporate in this project.Very
less user is involved during the development of these projects. Thus, this system is developed
