               Introduction
In the recent years, there has been an exponential progress in the field of machine learning and
artificial intelligence which has led to improvement in accuracy, reduction in human efforts
and failure rate. This development has played a commendable role in reducing processing
time, which has further led to improvement in net productivity and corresponding reduction in
the cost.
Object Detection(OD) is a challenging and exciting task in computer vision.It can be difficult
since there are all kinds of variations in orientation, lighting, background and occlusion that
can result in completely different images of the very same object.
The widely used object detection applications are humanâ€“computer interaction, video surveillance, satellite imagery, transport system, and activity recognition. In the wider family of deep
learning architectures, convolutional neural network (CNN) made up with set of neural network layers is used for visual imagery. Deep CNN architectures exhibit impressive results for
detection of objects in digital image.
The project comes with the technique of "Object Classification Using Light Weight CNN"
which includes various research sides of computer science. The project is to take a picture of
an object and process it up to recognize the image of that object like a human brain recognize
the various objects[1]. The project contains the deep idea of the Image Processing techniques
and the big research area of machine learning(ML) and the building block of the machine
learning called Neural Network .
